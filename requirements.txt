# Kafka Consumer: Seabaugh Edition (buzzline-05-seabaugh)

Welcome to **Kafka Consumer: Seabaugh Edition**, where real-time data processing meets fun and functionality! 🚀

## 📌 Overview
This Kafka consumer is designed to consume JSON messages from a live data stream, process them, and insert the results into an SQLite database. But wait—there’s more! It also tracks sentiment and categorizes messages based on keyword mentions. Think of it as your personal data butler, sorting and analyzing messages with precision and a touch of flair. 🎩✨

## 🔥 Features
- **Live Kafka Consumer**: Fetches messages in real time from a Kafka topic.
- **Keyword-Based Categorization**: Detects predefined keywords and assigns categories like `tech`, `gaming`, `food`, and more.
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Determines whether a message has `positive`, `negative`, or `neutral` sentiment.
- **SQLite Integration**: Stores processed messages for future analysis.
- **Smart Alerting**: Notifies when a recognized keyword is detected in a message.
- **Robust Logging**: Tracks every step, ensuring transparency and easy debugging.

## 🛠️ How It Works
1. **Message Consumption**: The script connects to Kafka and consumes messages from a specified topic.
2. **Processing Magic**: Each message is checked for keywords, categorized, and assigned a sentiment score.
3. **Data Storage**: Processed messages are inserted into an SQLite database for safekeeping.
4. **Alerts & Logs**: If a keyword is detected, the consumer logs an alert. If something goes wrong, it logs that too!

## 🏗️ Setup & Execution
### 1️⃣ Install Dependencies
Make sure you have the necessary Python packages installed. Run:
```bash
pip install kafka-python sqlite3
```

### 2️⃣ Configure Environment Variables

### 3️⃣ Start the Consumer
Run the script and watch the magic happen:
```bash

```

## 🧠 Fun Fact
This consumer doesn’t just process messages—it *appreciates* them. If you send a message with `meme`, it knows you’re in the mood for humor. If it sees `Python`, it knows you're a tech enthusiast. Smart, right? 🤓
